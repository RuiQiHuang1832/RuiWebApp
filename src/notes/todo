not gonna do fast loading with LS, proven i could do it already.

//do breadcrumb
eg. Nulled -> Leaks -> Cracked Programs.
// make an admin account
// admin account can delete post and ban users;

announcment main page/recently added needs to be updated

fix on mobile, long text goes over the page

still need to do "Last post" which shoudl be easy ->> finished this, just need to style it + make it like my 'threads' column, by caching it so it doesnt keep flickering when i change a different tab and so it doesnt need infinte calls to api
