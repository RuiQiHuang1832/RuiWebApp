working on Thread.jsx Right now.

finishing mapping it. have not done any bug test

so still needs optimization + tweaking + maybe styling and bug test.

still need to mess around with it

not gonna do acordiion, proven i could do it already
not gonna do fast loading with LS, proven i could do it already.

still need to do created at, started by, replies, (maybe) views. and the whole thread page.
pinned stuff as well.
etc..
