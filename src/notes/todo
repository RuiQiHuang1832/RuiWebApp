rework code..no inline stlying for example


might need to rework / getAll by only allowing users with ADMIN permission access rui.heroku / user / getAll

UserDashboard.jsx = need to rework the code..code looks gross and messy, performance can be improved if i rework implement
cache image to load faster
joined date
crop image thingy
if image to big, show user response
default iamge if not images!

unmounting BS, no white pages!! use spinner!! if loading on fetch!!!!!!!!!!

backend: change all API endpoint names!!!
// got fix blank pages....when user is deleted, "id" undefined when submitting settings page!!!!...if user is deleted key should be updated and user
should be logged out!!!
easiest way would be loggin user out!]

some header look like there are shadows at the bottom..this is because App.css now replaces all BG color and some 
components also painted their own bg colors so with both combined = no shadow..however if i only utilize App.css's background COLOR,
then it will show a shadow!

when loging in with Lord" "(with a space at the end) , the user is directed to a blank page
to solve this: remove space from login
