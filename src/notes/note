For Importing images:

Either put them in public and reference them using /path/path
but these cannot be imported outside of /src folder using "import"

Or you can use an actual URL link or you can put it in a css file and reference from there

For some reason, trying to reference as a style={variable} and defining the path in the backgroundImage: url(url) won't
work. THe work around is to either use an actual url, put in css folder, or put outside of src folder in the public

If however you are doing import image from " "; 
then it must be within src folder b/c importing outside of src is not supported but refercing outside is!
