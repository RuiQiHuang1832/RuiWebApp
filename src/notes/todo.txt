//     //do breadcrumb
//     eg.Nulled -> Leaks -> Cracked Programs.
// // make an admin account
// // admin account can delete post and ban users;

// announcment main page / recently added needs to be updated  ->>> did a bit of it, still needs tweaks, unfinished!!

// need to be ablet to delete stuff

// need to make checks to localStorage, if it gets edited, page gets refreshed

//if user changes user key, forcefully logout user or smthing..need to fix LS


/////whenever user clicks forum page, ls removes all keys which makes loading back into the home page slow
//a way to do this is just to only remove all ls when user clicks on "start new topic", other wise, its unnessary to remove all keys.
//pages: newTopic, template. need to edit these then check if it works on recentTopics and Lastpost.

^^ still need to fix htis


//home page double reloads...need to fix that..
