// still need to do , replies, (maybe) views.
// still need to update images in the thread. may or may not do the offline/online thingy...


// I can add a "last user" in my column db. now need last user replied


// pinned stuff as well.
// etc..

// announcment main page


//ls changes, site dies. somewhat fixed it. Done. Check home.jsx ENABLES ONLY IN TESTING
// VERY IMPORTANT: ALSO WHENEVER I RENDER A COMPONENT WITHIN A COMPONENET, IT WILL BE CONFUSING, SO JUST REMEMEBR HOW EACH COMPONENT WORKS WITHIN ANOTHER COMPONENET IF THEY DEPEND ON EACH OTHER!!




//another "not bug" but when loging out while in general discussion will briefly show 404 error thingy. so i shoudl cahnge it
//not a delay/server bug but instead its just somethign i did on the frontend. so yeah i should change that

















///////////////////////////Just making more edge cases for myself. Move on from this. Its behavior is normal.
//might refactor -> home -> general discussion. somehow make it load before accessing the general discussion. i can't do it in general discssion since what if a user loads to it from a different previous destination. need to somehow load onto GD and not showing the topics being loaded on. it should be instant 
//^ did some research and apparently its pretty hard to implement. there isn't' anything solid so I guess what i have is good For now
//HOWEVER, I want to try to utilize react.lazy and suspense. I already asked an AI for help so it should be on there.
look at that for future reference or when i work on this again.

//maybe use memo for loading onto page template ^^^. and only cahnges when depencdy is changed like a new post is created. that way, maybe it can load faster and doesnt require loading each time unless somethign is changed.
