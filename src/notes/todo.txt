// still need to do , replies, (maybe) views.
// pinned stuff as well.
// etc..



// // make an admin account
// // admin account can delete post and ban users;

// announcment main page

// need to be ablet to delete stuff

//processing the thread body, replie count, how do i store replie count in db?, last poster in thread

//ls changes, site dies. somewhat fixed it. Done. Check home.jsx ENABLES ONLY IN TESTING
// VERY IMPORTANT: ALSO WHENEVER I RENDER A COMPONENT WITHIN A COMPONENET, IT WILL BE CONFUSING, SO JUST REMEMEBR HOW EACH COMPONENT WORKS WITHIN ANOTHER COMPONENET IF THEY DEPEND ON EACH OTHER!!

NEXT
-> if admin ROLE -> reveal the delete button -> else nothing
-> going to achieve this using ls and encyprtions. I could also do cookies but ehhhh just going to do this for now but normally i would use cookies
^ DOne with this + Dne with backend
Now I just need to make it so FE passes in the credntials
^ most finished. Made it so when admin logins, I get a token saved to LS.
Now I just need to store that key also somehwer ein the server backend.
After that I will no longner have to pass admin:admin and instead only pass the token in my ls.
after passing that, i have to autheticate that token is exisitn in my server. Moving forward I will do this method.






















///////////////////////////Just making more edge cases for myself. Move on from this. Its behavior is normal.
//might refactor -> home -> general discussion. somehow make it load before accessing the general discussion. i can't do it in general discssion since what if a user loads to it from a different previous destination. need to somehow load onto GD and not showing the topics being loaded on. it should be instant 
//^ did some research and apparently its pretty hard to implement. there isn't' anything solid so I guess what i have is good For now
//HOWEVER, I want to try to utilize react.lazy and suspense. I already asked an AI for help so it should be on there.
look at that for future reference or when i work on this again.

//maybe use memo for loading onto page template ^^^. and only cahnges when depencdy is changed like a new post is created. that way, maybe it can load faster and doesnt require loading each time unless somethign is changed.
