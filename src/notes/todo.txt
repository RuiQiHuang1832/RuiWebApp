Lastest update: I assocaited backend userID with the username when the user posts. WHAT SHOULD I DO NEXT?
//fetched it and grabbed the images, however, a problem arises if user somehow just lands on the template page.
the images wont get loaded. this means I have to load it on template page itself. <=== on this part
//basically finished this part, but stuck on a part with localstorage. need to make it so if db is cleared, 
website should still be accessible. looking at Forum and Home,
//ERROR: if a newly created user doesnt have an imaeg, will cause error in template page


//really bad way to assocaite userimage with user id
if i delete a user, the index of where it is at will change and that might mess up the users pfp for another guys,

needs change
