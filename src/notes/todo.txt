// still need to do , replies, (maybe) views.
// pinned stuff as well.
// etc..



// // make an admin account
// // admin account can delete post and ban users;

// announcment main page

// need to be ablet to delete stuff

//processing the thread body, replie count, how do i store replie count in db?, last poster in thread

//ls changes, site dies. somewhat fixed it. Done. Check home.jsx ENABLES ONLY IN TESTING
// VERY IMPORTANT: ALSO WHENEVER I RENDER A COMPONENT WITHIN A COMPONENET, IT WILL BE CONFUSING, SO JUST REMEMEBR HOW EACH COMPONENT WORKS WITHIN ANOTHER COMPONENET IF THEY DEPEND ON EACH OTHER!!





//create an option to deletethe user which then calls the backend and sets a status for it

//on backend - the absolute path for the image needs to be a relative path or else it wont work when its public

//also how are deleted users still being logged in when i star my npm? ->> not that big of a bug but still..

//might refactor -> home -> general discussion. somehow make it load before accessing the general discussion. i can't do it in general discssion since what if a user loads to it from a different previous destination. need to somehow load onto GD and not showing the topics being loaded on. it should be instant 
//^ did some research and apparently its pretty hard to implement. there isn't' anything solid so I guess what i have is good For now
//HOWEVER, I want to try to utilize react.lazy and suspense. I already asked an AI for help so it should be on there.
look at that for future reference or when i work on this again.

//maybe use memo for loading onto page template ^^^. and only cahnges when depencdy is changed like a new post is created. that way, maybe it can load faster and doesnt require loading each time unless somethign is changed.


//on this right now. on home page, enter user name and the user will set active status from 1 to 0.
this needs to be on backend with a patchMapping for status on Post.
This allows me to test it first before implemting the delete feature on frontend.

//if topics is emtpy in Template. show something like "no topics..u can be the first one!"
