When user tries to sign up with new account,
it will display an error if duplicate. Leave it.

When suer tries to login with case insstiive username, 
it will allow login, but throw hella errors,

the fix to this would be to change everthing right now that is storing
the username, and isntead store something different like ID,
we should be loop through an ID and looking for that username in the DB, 
instead of just loop through the username because the user can be case insesitive on login..
doesnt really matter but ya know

If i don't want to do the above to save time, I can also just look at the JS folder for the duplicate collation,
but if i do that, it works, but when singing up (eg ZELDA and zelda) can be created. THIS IS FINE BECAUSE
NO WAY A USER MAKES THE SAME USERNAME but ya know just in case.
NO REALLY URGETN BUT STILL
