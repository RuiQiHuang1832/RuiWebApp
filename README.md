## Server Information

This application is hosted on [Render.com](https://render.com), a cloud platform for deploying and scaling web applications. Please be aware of the following information regarding server spin-up time and content:

- **Server Spin-up Time**: The application is hosted on a free version of Render.com, which has a spin-up time of approximately 15 minutes. As a result, the initial loading of the website may take some time. Subsequent visits will have faster loading times.

- **Content Placeholder**: The text and images you currently see on the website are placeholders used for illustrative purposes. They do not reflect the final content of the application and are included solely to provide an example structure.

I appreciate your patience during the spin-up time and encourage you to explore the website's functionality once it has fully loaded. For any inquiries or feedback, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Thank you for understanding!


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
